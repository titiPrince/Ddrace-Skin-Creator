# DDRACE SKIN CREATOR

Hi! Welcome on my webapp to create skins on the games Teeworlds and DDraceNetwork<br><br>

## About
Are you tired of using software like Gimp to create skins? <br>
Do you find it frustrating to export the skin and try it in the game?<br>
This webapp is the solution to your problems! ;) <br>
It comes with a preview feature to allow you to see how your skin will look in the game. <br>
In the future, there may even be a game preview where you can try your skin in a "simulated" game!<br><br>

Initially, I wanted to create a simple Plug-in for Gimp, but I quickly realized how complex it was. <br>
I also thought that beginners in skin creation may find it tedious to learn how to use software like Gimp or Inkscape. <br>
Hence, I decided to create this webapp to simplify the skin creation process.<br><br>

Please note that the webapp is currently in the Alpha version, and thus, it may have bugs and limited functionalities. <br>
I apologize in advance for any inconvenience caused.

## Installation 
To install the webapp, please follow these steps:

1. Download all the content of the `./public` directory. 
2. Open the `./public/app.html` file using any web browser such as Google Chrome.
3. Make sure to keep the directories `./public/assets`, `./public/scripts`, and `./public/styles` in the same directory as `./public/app.html`.

Please note that the webapp has been designed to be used as a non-local application, and it's possible that some assets from the CSS files may not be correctly imported.
